## Phase 1: Setup (Month 0–1)

### Visa Decision & Acquisition

Evaluate visa options (Destination Thailand Visa vs Long‑Term Resident) and secure the most suitable long‑stay visa before departure.

- Decide based on stay length, eligibility, and benefits:
  - Destination Thailand Visa (DTV) allows ~360 days continuous stay with one extension (see [Thai Embassy](https://www.thaiembassy.com/)).
  - Long‑Term Resident (LTR) offers 10‑year stability, no frequent visa runs, and tax incentives such as foreign income tax exemption (see [LTR Visa Program](https://ltr.boi.go.th/)).
- Prepare necessary documents and apply well ahead of departure so the visa is in hand pre‑move.

### City & Neighborhood Selection

Choose a primary base (e.g., Chiang Mai – Nimman/Suthep – vs. Bangkok).

- Factors: cost of living (Chiang Mai is significantly cheaper than Bangkok; see [Nomadicated](https://nomadicated.com/)), noise and air quality, community (tight‑knit nomad scene vs broader business network), and lifestyle preferences.
- Consider a scouting trip or consult local contacts to decide on the city and neighborhood that best support “silence” and focus.

### Housing – Apartment Scouting & Lease

Find and secure an apartment conducive to deep work.

- Criteria: low noise (soundproofing or high‑floor away from traffic), good natural light and view, amenities (pool, gym), reliable A/C, and space for a home office.
- Approach: start with a short‑term rental (1–2 weeks) via Airbnb or local agent to test the environment, then convert to a 6–12 month lease once satisfied.
- Admin: negotiate rent within budget and ensure the lease permits address registration (needed for TM30 reporting).

### Workspace Setup

Decide between a home office or an external private office/co‑working space.

- Home office: obtain ergonomic chair, desk, monitor; set up a distraction‑free area dedicated to work.
- External workspace: evaluate options (e.g., Yellow in Chiang Mai: [yellowincubator.com](https://yellowincubator.com/); Bangkok: True Digital Park, WeWork) for quiet environment and 24/7 access.
- Ensure the chosen workspace aligns with the “silence” goal and is ready before heavy work begins.

### Internet & Power Redundancy

Set up reliable internet and power to prevent downtime.

- Primary: high‑speed fiber internet (e.g., 300–1000 Mbps from AIS, True, or 3BB).
- Secondary: 4G/5G mobile hotspot or a second broadband line for failover.
- Power: UPS for router and laptop to ride out brief outages.
- Test failover scenarios to switch instantly to backup if needed.

## Phase 2: Deep Work Execution (Months 2–9)

### Quiet Routine & Productivity Systems

Establish a daily schedule that maximizes deep work and well‑being.

- Morning focus blocks when the environment is calm; mid‑day exercise or mindful activity to recharge; afternoon/evening session.
- Implement “maker time” blocks with no meetings; use systems (Linear/Notion, Pomodoro) to stay on track.
- Limit distractions (mute non‑essential notifications, noise‑cancelling headphones, ambient sounds, clutter‑free space).
- Weekly or bi‑weekly reviews to refine the routine for peak focus.

### Communication & Calendar Guardrails

Adopt an async‑friendly communication strategy that protects focus.

- Define channels and check windows (e.g., email/Slack in late afternoon) rather than instant responses.
- Share working hours and block deep‑work periods on the calendar; use Slack status or calendar signals for availability.
- Schedule brief syncs during time‑zone overlap (Thailand is ~14 hours ahead of SF), e.g., weekly evening check‑ins (morning PT).
- Provide an emergency channel (phone or separate app) reserved strictly for urgent matters.

### Burn Rate Tracking & Monthly Budget Ops

Monitor finances to keep burn dramatically lower than SF.

- Set target personal burn (e.g., 60–70% reduction from SF costs) and track expenses monthly.
- Categories: rent, utilities, groceries/eating out, transportation (scooter rental, Grab), co‑working, healthcare/insurance, discretionary.
- Review monthly against budget; adjust trends (e.g., curb eating‑out if costs creep).
- Startup burn: leverage lower local costs (regional pricing, local talent) where appropriate.

### Legal & Tax Compliance

Stay current on immigration rules and tax obligations.

- TM30 address report within 24 hours of move‑in (usually by landlord; ensure it’s filed) — see [Thai Embassy](https://www.thaiembassy.com/).
- 90‑day TM47 report if staying 90+ consecutive days; resets on exit/re‑entry — see [Thai Embassy](https://www.thaiembassy.com/).
- Re‑entry permits as required by visa before leaving Thailand.
- Tax considerations: >180 days may make you a Thai tax resident. Under current rules, foreign income earned and kept abroad until the next calendar year isn’t taxed locally. US citizens may leverage FEIE. LTR visa includes overseas income tax exemption — see [LTR Visa Program](https://ltr.boi.go.th/). Consult a professional and document your plan.
- Maintain digital and physical copies (passport, visa, TM6, lease, etc.); calendar renewals/extensions.

### Local Support Network

Build a lightweight support system.

- Identify a reliable visa agent or immigration lawyer for extensions/hiccups.
- Find an English‑speaking doctor and nearby hospital/clinic; ensure health insurance covers Thailand.
- Join local entrepreneur/expat communities (Facebook/Telegram) for camaraderie, referrals, and advice.
- Consider part‑time assistant or services (cleaning, grocery delivery) to free time and reduce burn via affordable labor.

## Phase 3: Mobility & Optimization (Months 6–10)

### Mid‑Point “Workation” Sprint (≈1 month)

Plan an optional 1‑month relocation for a focused work sprint to refresh creativity.

- Example destinations: Hua Hin (Thailand), Da Nang (Vietnam), etc.
- Visa logistics: DTV permits nearly a year continuous; LTR allows unlimited exit/re‑entry — confirm specifics (see [Thai Embassy](https://www.thaiembassy.com/) and [LTR Visa Program](https://ltr.boi.go.th/)).
- Arrange housing with verified strong internet and quiet workspace; set clear sprint goals; limit sightseeing/socializing.

### Workspace & Lifestyle Audit (around month 6)

Evaluate and optimize for performance.

- Address noise (higher‑grade earplugs, ANC headphones, or relocate).
- Improve ergonomics (better chair, monitor, standing desk).
- Adjust schedule for energy dips (e.g., short nap, walk).
- Ensure exercise and nutrition meet goals; add structure/automation as needed.
- Audit meetings/processes: eliminate or batch low‑value time; automate/delegate repetitive tasks.

### Regional Exploration (Optional)

Schedule occasional, controlled short trips for inspiration without disrupting work.

- Examples: Pai or Chiang Rai (from Chiang Mai), Siem Reap.
- Logistics: file new TM30 on return to Thailand; ensure multi‑entry visa/re‑entry permits are in order — see [Thai Embassy](https://www.thaiembassy.com/).
- Keep trips short (3–4 days) and infrequent; use as rewards after milestones.

## Phase 4: Re‑evaluation & Next Steps (Months 11–12)

### Year‑End Productivity Review

Assess outcomes of the relocation in terms of personal and business progress.

- Business: milestones shipped, user growth metrics, funding/runway extension.
- Deep work: hours and quality vs SF baseline; overall creative output.
- Health: routine, fitness, and mental well‑being improvements.
- Financials: total 12‑month spend vs SF baseline; quantify savings.
- Analyze any missed goals and root causes; capture lessons learned.

### Long‑Run Ambition Alignment

Decide the path forward aligned with long‑term goals.

- Options: continue in Thailand (possibly different city or visa), return to SF/another hub for GTM/networking/fundraising, or try another low‑burn locale.
- Hybrid: 3–6 months in a quiet location for building; remainder in a network‑rich city for selling/partnering/raising.
- Weigh startup trajectory: whether to stay in “builder mode” or move to “scale mode,” while preserving silence, autonomy, and efficient burn.

### Project Wrap‑Up & Transition

Execute wrap‑up tasks for a smooth transition.

- Notices: apartment and co‑working termination aligned to lease terms; sell or donate items; settle utilities/phone bills.
- Immigration: final visits (e.g., exit report/cancellation as required); last 90‑day report if timing overlaps.
- Backups: secure all important documents and project files.
- Community: express thanks to local contacts; maintain key relationships.
- Personal handbook: distill best practices (morning routine, focus techniques, budget hacks) to carry forward.
