# CMO Agent Internal FAQ

## Product & Technology

### What makes CMO Agent different from existing marketing tools?

**Q: How is CMO Agent different from tools like Outreach.io or SalesLoft?**
A: While Outreach.io and SalesLoft are generic sales automation tools, CMO Agent is specifically designed for developer marketing. It understands GitHub behavior patterns, analyzes code contributions, and personalizes messaging based on technical context rather than just job titles and company size.

### How does the AI personalization work?

**Q: What AI models does CMO Agent use?**
A: We use GPT-4 Turbo as our primary model for natural language processing and personalization. We also fine-tune custom models on developer behavior data and use OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 for semantic search and prospect matching.

**Q: How accurate is the personalization?**
A: Our personalization achieves 95%+ accuracy in identifying technical interests and 89% accuracy in predicting engagement likelihood. This is validated through A/B testing with our beta customers.

### What's the technical architecture?

**Q: What programming languages and frameworks do you use?**
A: The core engine is built in Python using FastAPI for the API layer. We use PostgreSQL for metadata storage, Redis for caching and message queues, and Pinecone for vector search. The frontend is built with Next.js and TypeScript.

**Q: How do you handle GitHub API rate limits?**
A: We have an official GitHub partnership that provides enhanced rate limits (15,000 requests/hour vs. 5,000 for standard apps). We also implement intelligent caching, request deduplication, and adaptive throttling.
