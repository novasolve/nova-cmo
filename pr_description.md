# 🎨 Enhanced Logging with tqdm Progress Bars & Live Email Counting

## 🎯 Overview

This PR implements a comprehensive beautiful logging system for the CMO Agent with **tqdm-style progress bars** and **live email counting** during campaign execution. The enhancement transforms the user experience from silent processing to real-time visual feedback with professional-grade progress tracking.

## ✨ Key Features Implemented

### 🔥 **Live Email Discovery Progress**

```
🔍 Finding emails for 99 users: 100%|████████████████| 99/99 [01:12<00:00, 1.4users/s, emails=14]
```

- **Real-time email count updates** as each user is processed
- **Processing rate display** (users/second)
- **ETA estimates** for completion
- **Visual progress bars** with completion percentage

### 🎨 **Beautiful Console Output**

```

### 📁 **Enhanced Output Management**

- **Job-specific log files** (`job-20250831-123456.log`)
- **Automatic CSV export** to logs directory
- **Campaign summary reports** with structured data
- **JSON log entries** for machine parsing

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Core Components Added:**

1. **Enhanced Configuration** (`cmo_agent/core/state.py`)

   - Expanded `DEFAULT_CONFIG.logging` with beautiful console options
   - Added `job_specific_files`, `stage_logging`, `progress_logging`
   - Correlation ID support and metrics snapshots

2. **Progress Tracking** (`cmo_agent/tools/github.py`)

   - Enhanced `FindCommitEmailsBatch` with live email counting
   - Enhanced `EnrichGitHubUsers` with progress tracking
   - Real-time progress updates during tool execution

3. **Agent Integration** (`cmo_agent/agents/cmo_agent.py`)

   - Beautiful logger initialization per job
   - Stage transition logging in auto-progress
   - Automatic output file saving to logs directory
   - Error handling with beautiful formatting

4. **Dependencies** (`cmo_agent/requirements.txt`)
   - Added `tqdm>=4.66.0` for professional progress bars

### **Smoke Test Enhancement:**

5. **Enhanced Smoke Test Configuration** (`cmo_agent/config/smoke_prompt.yaml`)

   - **NEW FILE**: Complete configuration for enhanced logging
   - Enables real execution (not dry-run) to show progress bars
   - Optimized for smoke test performance

6. **Frontend Integration**
   - Updated smoke test button to use exact same command as manual execution
   - Modified API routes to use `smoke_prompt.yaml` config
   - Updated CLI scripts for consistency

## 🎯 **Smoke Test Button Now Matches Manual Command**

**Before:** Generic smoke test with different configuration  
**After:** Exact same execution as manual command:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=.. python -m cmo_agent.scripts.run_agent --config cmo_agent/config/smoke_prompt.yaml "python developers with activity in the last 90 days"
```

**Smoke Test Button Configuration:**

- ✅ **Goal:** `"python developers with activity in the last 90 days"` (exact match)
- ✅ **Config:** `"cmo_agent/config/smoke_prompt.yaml"` (exact match)
- ✅ **Execution:** Real campaign with enhanced logging and tqdm progress

## 📊 **User Experience Transformation**

### **Before Enhancement:**

```
[18:06:55] ✅ INFO    Starting email discovery...
[18:07:45] ✅ INFO    Email discovery completed
```

### **After Enhancement:**

```
[18:06:55] 🚀 Phase: Enrichment – Finding emails for 99 users [job-abc123]
