## ðŸ”§ Usage with Attio

The `lead_id` field serves as the unique record identifier for Attio. When importing:

1. Map `lead_id` as the unique identifier
2. Map `email_public_commit` to the email field
3. Map `github_user_url` and `github_repo_url` as custom fields
4. Use `signal` and `signal_at` for engagement tracking
5. Map social fields (`twitter_username`, `blog`) for enrichment
